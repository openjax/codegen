## Introduction

OpenJAX CodeGen RadixTree generates a [Radix Tree][radix-tree] of keywords as a Java `Enum` for time-optimized lookup operations.

This module takes a list of keywords as an input, and produces a Java `Enum` that allows incremental, optimized lookup operations.

With the generated `Enum`, a program can thereafter perform lookups for matching keywords, character by character. Each next character narrows the search space of the matching enums by stepping deeper into the radix tree.

## Performance

Lookup operations are performed incrementally. Each next character narrows the search space of the matching enums by stepping deeper into the radix tree. At each character input, a binary search is performed for the terms that have been narrowed by the previous character. Each Radix Tree `Enum` therefore has different specific performance, because it is based on the chosen keywords.

```
  Let: n·µ¢ = average number of keyword nodes at depth ùñé
  Let: ùñó  = average number of keyword characters (i.e. average depth of the radix tree)
```

The first character lookup performs in `O(log n‚ÇÄ)` time, where `n‚ÇÄ` is the number of children of the node matched from the 1st character.<br>
The next character lookup performs in `O(log n‚ÇÅ)` time, where `n‚ÇÅ` is the number of children of the node matched from the 2nd character.<br>
The next character lookup performs in `O(log n‚ÇÇ)` time, where `n‚ÇÇ` is the number of children of the node matched from the 3rd character.<br>
The next character lookup performs in `O(log n‚ÇÉ)` time, and so on...

### Large Lists

For large lists of keywords, each character lookup after the first is performed in `O(log n·µ£‚Çä‚ÇÅ)` time. Each next lookup reduces with the subsequent lookup by the square, on average. As ùñé approaches ùñó, Big-O complexity approaches constant time. The performance of whole-word lookups for large lists can be expressed as:

```
                                                        ·µ£
  O(log n‚ÇÄ) + O(log n‚ÇÅ) + O(log n‚ÇÇ) + ... + O(log n·µ£) = ‚àë O(log n·µ¢)
                                                       ‚Å±‚Åº‚Å∞
```

We can infer that:

```
  O(log n‚ÇÄ) > O(log n‚ÇÅ) > O(log n‚ÇÇ) > ... > O(log n·µ£)
```

Which allows us to estimate:

```
  ·µ£
  ‚àë O(log n·µ¢) < ùñó * O(log n‚ÇÄ)
 ‚Å±‚Åº‚Å∞
```

Since `ùñó` is a constant, it can be removed.

```
  ·µ£
  ‚àë O(log n·µ¢) ‚âà O(log n‚ÇÄ)
 ‚Å±‚Åº‚Å∞
```

### Small Lists

For small lists of keywords, the same rules apply as for large lists. For small lists, however, Big-O complexity approaches constant time even faster, resulting in the same estimate:

```
  O(log n‚ÇÄ)
```

## Usage

### Generation of `RadixTreeEnum`
Suppose you want to create a `RadixTreeEnum` from the keywords in the [illustration above](#illustration).

```java
  String className = "Keyword";
  File outFile = new File(className + ".java");
  String[] keywords = new String[] {"romane", "romanus", "romulus", "rubens", "ruber", "rubicon", "rubicundus"};
  RadixTreeEnumGenerator.generate(className, outFile, keywords);
```

The `RadixTreeEnumGenerator.generate(...)` method will build the `RadixTreeEnum`, and will write it to `Keyword.java`.

### Lookup into `RadixTreeEnum`

Suppose you want to look up the `Keyword` matching the string `"rubens"`:

```java
  String string = "rubens";
  Keyword word = null;
  for (int i = 0; i < string.length(); ++i) { // [N]
    char ch = string.charAt(i);
    word = Keyword.findNext(word, i, ch);
    System.out.println(ch + ": " + word);
    if (word == null)
      break; // The tree does not contain the string
  }
```

This code shows how the generated `Keyword` enum can be used to perform lookups for matching values, character-by-character. The output of this code will be:

```
r: rubens
u: rubens
b: ruber
e: ruber
n: rubens
s: rubens
```

The output shows that `Keyword.RUBENS` was in fact matched from the first character lookup, which supports the `O(log n‚ÇÄ)` [performance estimate](#performance).

### `codegen-maven-plugin`

The [`codegen-maven-plugin`](/../../../codegen-maven-plugin) can be used to generate RadixTree enums during the build lifecycle, in a phase such as `generate-sources`.
